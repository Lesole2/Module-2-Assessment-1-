                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>A giraffe is a tall, long-necked mammal native to the African savannas and grasslands.</p>
                    <P>It is known for its distinctive appearance, including its long neck, long legs, and unique spotted coat pattern.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with adult males reaching heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) and females reaching slightly shorter heights.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves from trees and shrubs, particularly acacia trees.</p>
                    <p>Their long necks allow them to reach high into the trees to access foliage that other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    <p>They are social animals that often gather in loose groups, although their social structure can vary depending on factors such as food availability and habitat.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are also known for their distinctive behavior, including their slow and graceful gait, as well as their interactions with other members of their herd.</p>
