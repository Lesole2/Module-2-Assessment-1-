                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>A tiger is a large carnivorous cat native to various parts of Asia, including India, Russia, and Southeast Asia.</p> 
                    <p>is known for its striking orange coat with black stripes, which helps it camouflage in its forest habitat.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are apex predators and primarily hunt large ungulates such as deer and wild boar. 
                        They are solitary animals, with each individual maintaining a large territory to hunt and roam.</p>                        
                    <p>Tigers are iconic symbols of strength and beauty but are threatened by extinction, making their conservation a global priority.</p>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
                    <p>You will find them at the Lost Forest</p>
