                    <p>A lion is a large carnivorous mammal found in Africa and Asia. Known for its majestic appearance and distinctive mane (in males), lions live in groups called prides and primarily hunt large ungulates like zebras and wildebeests.</p>
                    <P>They play a crucial role as apex predators in their ecosystems but face threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts aim to protect lion populations and their habitats.</p>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
                    <P>You will find them at the Lost Forest</P>
