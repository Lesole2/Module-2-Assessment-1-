                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in Africa. They are known for their distinctive appearance, which includes large tusks, warty protrusions on their faces, and a mane of hair along their backs. 
                        Warthogs are omnivores, feeding on grasses, roots, fruits, and sometimes small animals
                        They are primarily active during the day and are often found in savannas, grasslands, and woodland areas.
                        Warthogs typically live in burrows, which they excavate or modify from abandoned dens dug by other animals.
                        Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystems by aerating the soil through their digging activities and by serving as prey for carnivores.
                        They are relatively common throughout their range, but they face threats such as habitat loss, hunting, and competition with domestic livestock for resources. However, they are not currently considered endangered.</p>
