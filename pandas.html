                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are large black-and-white bears native to China.</p>
                    <p>They are known for their distinctive appearance, with black patches around their eyes, ears, and across their bodies. Pandas primarily feed on bamboo, which makes up the majority of their diet.</p>
                    <p>These bears are solitary animals, except during mating season or when a mother is caring for her cubs. They spend a significant amount of time eating bamboo and can consume large quantities each day due to its low nutritional value.</p>
                    <P>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</P>
