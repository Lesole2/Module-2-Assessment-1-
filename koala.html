                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>A koala is a small marsupial native to Australia. It is well-known for its distinctive appearance, with a stout body, large fluffy ears, a prominent black nose, and thick grey fur.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are arboreal animals, which means they spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees, feeding primarily on eucalyptus leaves.</p>
                    <p>Koalas have a specialized diet consisting almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrition and high in fiber. They have a unique digestive system adapted to break down the tough leaves, which are toxic to many other animals.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are marsupials, which means they carry their young in a pouch. After a short gestation period, koala joeys are born undeveloped and crawl into their mother's pouch to continue their development. They remain in the pouch for several months before gradually venturing out and riding on their mother's back.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are considered iconic symbols of Australia and are popular with both locals and visitors. However, they face threats such as habitat loss, disease, and climate change, which have led to population declines in some areas. Conservation efforts are underway to protect koala populations and their habitats</p>
